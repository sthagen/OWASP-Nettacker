# Introduction


OWASP Nettacker is open-source software written in Python language using **YAML-type** modules that let you automate penetration testing and Information Gathering. This software aims to have all security tests you can do in a network, such as vulnerability scan and management (with or without CVE), brute force attacks, misconfiguration, and more. The purpose of this project is to speed up internal and external security assessments.
