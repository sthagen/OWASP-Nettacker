  name: subdomain_takeover_vuln
  author: OWASP Nettacker Team
  severity: 5
  description: "let us assume that example.com is the target and that the team running example.com have a bug bounty programme. While enumerating all of the subdomains belonging to example.com — a process that we will explore later — a hacker stumbles across subdomain.example.com, a subdomain pointing to GitHub pages. We can determine this by reviewing the subdomain's DNS records; in this example, subdomain.example.com has multiple A records pointing to GitHub's dedicated IP addresses for custom pages."
